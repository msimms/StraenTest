# StraenTest

## Purpose
Test data for fitness apps as well as GPX, TCX, and FIT file parsers. The goal is to collect GPX, TCX, and FIT files that contain various data fields and being generated by various devices. I'm also collecting fitness-based accelerometer data, in CSV format.

## Accelerometer Data (CSV format)
* Pull Ups
* Push Ups
* Squats
* Running
* Hiking

## Location Data (GPX, TCX, and FIT format)
* Running
* Hiking
* Cycling

## Sources
All of the data in this repository was either generated by me, or given to me, with the intention of using it for test purposes.

## Contributing
If you have any data you want to contribute, that's great. Simply fork the project, add your files, and submit a pull request.
